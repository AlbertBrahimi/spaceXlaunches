# Space X Launches

While the project fetches real data, its primary purpose is to practice and demonstrate the use of these technologies in a practical environment.

We have also implemented **Ant Design** components to enhance the user interface with tables, pagination, and skeleton loading.

# Backend Technologies:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime used for building the backend server.
Express.js: Web framework for handling routes and HTTP requests.
MySQL: Relational database used for storing user authentication data.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure user authentication.
bcrypt: For password hashing to ensure security.

## Features

- **Login**: we have implemented a login for the user, using the mentioned technologies for the backend.
- **GraphQL for Data Fetching**: The project uses GraphQL to fetch launch data, providing efficient and flexible data queries.
- **Apollo Client**: Apollo Client is used for managing remote and local data with GraphQL, handling caching, and query execution.
- **GraphQL Code Generation**: We have integrated **graphql-codegen** to automate the generation of TypeScript types and hooks for GraphQL queries and mutations.
- **Ant Design UI**: The project uses Ant Design for building user-friendly tables, providing features like pagination and skeleton loaders for improved UI.
- **TypeScript Integration**: TypeScript is used throughout the project to provide static typing, improve code quality, and catch errors during development.

## Key Technologies

- **Express**: For handling routes and HTTP requests.
- **JWT**: For secure user authentication.
- **React**: For building the user interface and managing the component lifecycle.
- **GraphQL**: Used to query SpaceX API and efficiently fetch only the required data.
- **Apollo Client**: To handle GraphQL requests and manage client-side state.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing and ensures type safety across the application.
- **Ant Design**: For creating tables, pagination, and implementing skeleton loaders.

One of the key features of this app is pagination, which can handle large amount of data.
